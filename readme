A collection of university assignments from 2013

COMP20005 - Engineering Computation
-----------------------------------
Assignment 1: Write (in C) a program which, given a set of data about earthquakes, 
			  will output a correctly formatted summary of that data

Assignment 2: Write (in C) a program which will give a summary of the lighting conditions in a parking lot.
			  Input: A set of lamp post positions and intensities, a set of points to test light intensity at
			  and a set of points describing the boundary of the parking lot.
			  Output: 1. Number of lamp posts and light intensity at the origin
			  		  2. Light intensity at each point specified in input
			  		  3. Summary of number of points sampled and number with light level below a threshold
			  		  4. A plot of the points sampled and the light intensity at each
			  		  5. The same plot, with the outline of the parking lot shown.

COMP20003 - Algorithms and Data Structures
-----------------------------------------
Assignment 1: Implement a linked list and skiplist data structure in C, and write a report examining the difference in
			  computation time between the two data structures.

Assignment 2: Graph search. Given a set of cities, each with some set of emergency supplies, and a set of distances between
			  cities, find the shortest paths by which emergency supplies can be brought to an given city.
			  Implementation is a modified form of the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm.
